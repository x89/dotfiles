%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines

				\item Repeat contracts for numerous clients generally in the area of Linux sysadmin and DevOps. Some software engineering and scripting
				\item Technologies: Docker, Qemu/KVM, OpenVPN, Ansible, Jenkins, Puppet, Python, Perl, Bash, AWS (Cloud Formation, EC2, S3, ECS, Route53, ELB, ASG,  \ldots), CloudFlare, Git, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Apache, uwsgi, and more
				\item I have outlined below a portion of the work done for my clients over the years.

			\item[] Client: Daniel Medveczky, EQRaffle, RSBooster, \ldots
			\begin{innerlist}
				\item My client's project was overloaded and they hired me as a specialist who could move them to the cloud for scalability.
				\item This was extremely enjoyable as I was given complete freedom to design from scratch their infrastructure. I migrated their single cPanel based dedicated server to a staging/production environment on AWS's EC2. I worked closely with my client and his developers to determine the correct set-up for them and scaled it accordingly, it involved EC2 instances, an ELB, CloudFront, RDS databases and monitoring.

			\item[] Client: Steve Tuttle, CloudWorks
			\begin{innerlist}
				\item I was contracted to create a continuous deployment strategy utilising AWS's Cloud Formation, EC2 and RDS alongside a Puppet master server to manage the Puppet agents. This required using Cloud Formation with a variable number of EC2 instances which would bootstrap themselves from AMIs allowing the EC2 instances to communicate with the Puppet master and automatically deploy their web app with continuous updates based on pushes to Github.
				\item This was a challenging but enjoyable role. Working with Linux, AWS and the DevOps stack is what I love.

				\item I was contracted as a Linux sysadmin to maintain their back-end servers, used by thousands of people for their hand-held label devices.
				\item Duties: Up-scaling operations; troubleshooting downtime; eradicating a rootkit that they'd contracted under a previous contractor; reconfiguring and optimising both Apache and MySQL; planning for minimal downtime during migrations; master-slave MySQL mirroring; scripting backups
				\item Technologies: Apache Servermix, Apache HTTP, Exim mail server, Ubuntu 14.04, iptables firewall, fail2ban, MySQL, DKIM + SPF, DNS
