%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section

% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.

% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be

\section{About me}
What I'm looking for more than anything is to get into a Senior DevOps role, that has been my number one priority for the past two years and what I see myself doing for the foreseeable future. I have already made great strides towards that end in my own time and by selecting work for clients involved in high level Linux sysadmin and DevOps related technologies. \\
I know that my current Linux sysadmin abilities are extremely good as I have been running dedicated and cloud servers and VPSs since 2006, I have run them since before I started at university and continue to administer them to this day. \\
Though freelancing I've taught myself a great many skills in the world of sysadmin/DevOps but what I'm really looking for now is to hone those skills to perfection in a permanent work environment.

\begin{outerlist}
	\item[] \textbf{Freelance Linux System Administrator} \\
	\textit{September 2014 until today}
	\begin{innerlist}
		\item Repeat contracts for numerous clients generally in the area of Linux DevOps/sysadmin/software engineering
		\item Technologies include: Docker, Qemu/KVM, OpenVPN, Puppet, Python, Perl, Bash, AWS (Cloud Formation, EC2, S3, \ldots), CloudFlare, Git, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Nginx/Apache/uwsgi, etc
		\item Duties include: migration, configuration and set-up, security, service optimisation, monitoring, benchmarking, auto-scaling, networking, \ldots
	\end{innerlist}
	\item[] Client: Leo Hämäläinen
	\begin{innerlist}
		\item Leo has been my client for the past $\approx$ 7 months
		\item I have been contracted as a Linux sysadmin for their operations at \href{http://devoca.fi}{devoca.fi}, a backend for their hand-held label device and other products with hundreds of clients throughout Finland and elsewhere who rely on Devoca's servers to operate
		\item Duties have included: Upscaling operations; troubleshooting downtime; eradicating a rootkit that they'd contracted under a previous contractor; optimising both Apache and MySQL's configurations; planning for minimal downtime during migration periods; master-slave MySQL mirroring; backup script writing
		\item Technologies include: Apache Servermix, Apache HTTP, Exim mail server (MTA), Ubuntu 14.04, iptables firewall, fail2ban, MySQL, DKIM + SPF, DNS
		\item Communication has been key to my success in this role
	\end{innerlist}
	\item[] Client: CloudWorks
	\begin{innerlist}
		\item I was contracted to set up a continuous deployment strategy utilising AWS's Cloud Formation, EC2 and RDS alongside a Puppet master server to manage the deployed servers. This required writing from scratch a Cloud Formation script with a variable number of EC2 instances which would image themselves from an AMI which would connect to a Puppet master server and auto-configure themselves with an app hosted on Github.
		\item This has been the most challenging but also most enjoyable role I have done so far. Working within Linux, AWS and DevOps is where I feel completely at home and find myself loving the work that I do, impressing myself with my own abilities.
		\item Technologies: AWS, EC2, RDS, Route53, Puppet, PostgreSQL, troposphere, cloud-config, Cloud Formation
